We strongly believe in open and **reproducible deep learning research**. Our goal is to implement an open-source **medical image segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch**. We also implemented a bunch of data loaders of the most common medical image datasets.  This project started as an [MSc Thesis](https://nemertes.lis.upatras.gr/jspui/handle/10889/12754 "MSc thesis link") and is currently **under further development**. Although this work was initially focused on **3D multi-modal brain MRI segmentation** we are slowly adding more architectures and data-loaders.  

#### Top priorities 21-07

[Update] 21-07 We have just received a brand new GPU. The project development was postponed due to lack of computational resources. We will be back with more updates. Please Watch our Github repository for releases to be notified. We are always looking for passionate open-source contributors. Full credits will be given.

- [ ] Project restructure, API/CLI design ++
- [ ] Minimal test prediction example with pre-trained models
- [ ] Overlapping and non-overlapping inference
- [ ] Finalize preprocessing on Brats datasets
- [ ] Save produced 3d-total-segmentation as nifty files
- [ ] Medical image decathlon dataloaders
- [ ] StructSeg 2019 challenge dataloaders
- [ ] More options for 2D architectures
- [ ] Rewrite manual
- [ ] New notebooks with Google Colab support

## Quick Start

- If you want to quickly understand the fundamental concepts for deep learning in medical imaging, we strongly advice to check our [blog post](https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/ "MedicalZooPytorch article"). We provide a general high-level overview of all the aspects of medical image segmentation and deep learning.

- Recently, I have published another article on medical image coordinated and DICOM images. Link [here](https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/).

- For a more holistic approach on Deep Learning in MRI you may advice my thesis [this](https://nemertes.lis.upatras.gr/jspui/handle/10889/12754 "MSc thesis link").

- Alternatively, you can create a **virtual environment** and install the requirements. Check the installation folder for more instructions.

- You can also take a quick glance at the [manual](./manual/README.md).

- If you do not have a capable environment or device to run this projects then you could give Google Colab a try. It allows you to run the project using a GPU device, free of charge. You may try our Colab demo using this notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/black0017/MedicalZooPytorch/blob/master/Quickstart_MedicalZoo.ipynb)

In general, in the open source community recognizing third party utilities increases the credibility of your software. In deep learning, **academics tend to skip acknowledging third party repos for some reason**. In essence, we used whatever resource we needed to make this project self-complete, that was nicely written. However, **modifications were performed to match the project structure and requirements**.
